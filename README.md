# Divi_Dead_to_VNDS
Divi Dead to VNDS

The conversion is done with Python3 and the a.exe for uncompression of the images.
a.exe is the LZ.c file compiled and is going to be use by the to_vnds.py.

This conversion was possible only cause this project exists : https://github.com/gameblabla/divi-dead

To convert Divi Dead download this repository and unpack the files to the root directory of you Divi Dead's copy.
Then run the to_vnds.py
This will create an out folder were are the exported data of the game and a vnds folder.
In vnds folder there will be a folder named novel that will include all the files needed to run the game.

MIDI files are not converted by the script.
If you want music you have to convert them to mp3 and then copy then to the sound directory of the novel.

The novel is converted to the so called high resolution for VNDS 640x480

Have fun.
